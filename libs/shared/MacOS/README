Place all shared libraries (.dylib) for MacOS in this directory and any frameworks is the Framework directory.
You should create universal (32/64 bit) versions, or update the Xcode projects to only use the CPU architecture you require.
You can use the lipo tool to combine 32/64 bit dylibs into one.

Any licences for them need to be placed in the libs\licences.
See the README for the libs directory for details on how they should be formatted.

Make sure that any dylibs have the correct install path. Use otool -L to check and install_name_tool to change it to
@executable_path/../Frameworks/
