	Icons are automatically added if there is a directory called icons at the project root directory level.
	
	DIRECTORY: MyProject
					MySource.cxs
					MySource.data
					icons
						icon.iconset
							icon_XxY.png
							icon_XxY@2x.png
						icon.ico
					
	icon_XxY.png and icon_XxY@2x.png are Apple naming for icons X is for horizontal and Y is for vertial resolutions.
	e.g icon_512x512 and @2x is for retina displays. You must stick to the naming used here.
	icon.ico is for MS Windows. You can make this up in under 2 minutes with GIMP or Photoshop.
